[21/01/01]	FGR, HJB	langsel.c, langsel_mac.c, mswin.c, applemac.c
		Installed translations for Edit menu on mac and PC
		provided by Fernando Gabriel Ranea.

[17/01/01]	FGR, HJB	langsel.c, langsel_mac.c
		Corrections to translations by Fernando Gabriel Ranea, installed
		by HJB with revisions to menu bar accelerators.

[12/01/01]	HJB	applemac.c
		Added include of langsel.h.  Added routine ReWriteStr255 to rewrite
		menu bar items in place and tostr255 to convert other menu items
		strings to Pascal form for use in SetmenuItemText.  Set up
		ReDrawWindow to refresh all menu strings and then redraw the menu
		bar.  Note that the rewrite of the main menu bar is _very_ risky
		and may not survive system changes.

[12/01/01]	HJB	command.c
		Added include of langsel.h.  Remove redundant ErrorMsg array and Err...
		definitions.  Change messages to reference MsgStrs.  Add English and
		Spanish as commands calling SwitchLang.

[12/01/01]	HJB	infile.c
		Fix coordinate typo in load of XYZ and Mol2 molecules.

[12/01/01]	HJB	langsel.c, langsel_mac.c, langsel.h
		New routines to carry multi-lingual translations.  Many thanks to
		Fernando Gabriel Ranea for the bulk of the Spanish translations,
		and for creating the initial Spanish version of RasMol 2.7.1.  Note
		that langsel.c uses the ANSI character set, while lansel_mac.c uses the
		Macintosh character set.

[12/01/01]	HJB	molecule.c
		Added include of langsel.h.  Changed messages to reference MsgStrs.
		Refixed D2O misparse, which had been previously fixed.  Mod had been
		lost.

[12/01/01]	HJB	mswin31.c
		Added include of raswin.idm and langsel.h.  Included partial update
		to printer logic.  Added ReDrawWindow as rewrite of menus with
		ModifyMenu and RemoveMenu/AppendMenu calls.

[12/01/01]	HJB	rasmac.c
		Added include of langsel.h.  Added SwitchLang(English) calls
		for initialization to main routine.

[12/01/01]	HJB	rasmol.c
		Add fix for broken math routines by referencing atan2.

[12/01/01]	HJB	rasmol.h
		Added include of langsel.h.  Added SwitchLang(English) calls
		for initialization to main routine.

[12/01/01]	HJB	raswin.c
		Added include of langsel.h.  Changed font of command window to ANSI
		character set.  Changed most messages to reference MsgStrs.  Add
		SwitchLang(English) calls for initialization to WinMain.

[12/01/01]	HJB	x11win.c
		Restructured MenuItem and BarItem to make .text, .pos and .len
		indirect, so that they can be fetched from MsgStrs, MsgAuxl and
		MsgLens.  The .pos field is used to specify the character offset
		of the acceleration key.  The main menu bar may now have non-zero
		offsets.  All the menu items have been changed to MsgStrs[StrM...]
		referecences, and added include of langsel.h.  Added ReDrawWindow
		simply as a call to ReSizeWindow.  This is overkill, but appropriate
		for these infrequent calls.

[12/01/01]	HJB	tokens.h
		Added tokens EnglishTok and SpanishTok.

[12/01/01]	HJB	graphics.h
		Added prototype of ReDrawWindow, a system-dependent call to be used
		after updating menus on language changes.

[12/01/01]	HJB	cmndline.c
		Added include of langsel.h, changed prompts as follows:
		
		"PDB file name:"		MsgStrs[StrPrmtPDB]
		"Image file name:"		MsgStrs[StrPrmtImg]
		"Molecule file name:"	MsgStrs[StrPrmtMol]
		
		

[12/01/01]	HJB	tokens.c
		Added the following tokens:
