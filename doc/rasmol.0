NAME
     RasMol 2.3 - Molecular Graphics Visualisation Tool


SYNOPSIS
     rasmol [options] [ _p_d_b_f_i_l_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     RasMol2 is an X11  windows  system  tool  intended  for  the
     visualisation of proteins and nucleic acids. RasMol requires
     either an 8bit pseudo colour or a 24bit (32bit) true  colour
     display. The program reads in a specified Brookhaven protein
     databank (PDB) file and determines the connectivity from the
     residue  information provided. This may then rendered on the
     screen in a variety of formats and colour schemes. Currently
     available   molecule   representations   include  depth-cued
     wireframes, sticks, space filling `union of  spheres',  ball
     and stick models and protein ribbon diagrams.


COMMANDS
     RasMol allows the execution of interactive commands typed at
     the RasMol> prompt in the terminal window. Each command must
     be given on a separate line. Keywords are  case  insensitive
     and  may  be  entered in either upper or lower case letters.
     All whitespace characters are  ignored  except  to  separate
     keywords and their arguments.

     The commands/keywords currently  recognised  by  RasMol  are
     given below.


     Backbone
          The RasMol backbone command permits the  representation
          of a polypeptide backbone as a series of bonds connect-
          ing the adjacent alpha carbons of each amino acid in  a
          chain.  The display of these backbone `bonds' is turned
          on and off by the command paramater  the  same  as  the
          wireframe  command.  The command backbone off turns off
          the selected `bonds', and backbone on or with a  number
          turns  them on. The number can be used to determine the
          cylinder radius of the representation in 0.004 angstrom
          units.  Backbone  objects  may  be  coloured  using the
          RasMol colour backbone command. A  parameter  value  of
          500 (2 angstroms) or above results in an "Integer argu-
          ment too large" error.


     Background
          The RasMol background command is used to set the colour
          of  the "canvas" background. The colour may be given as
          either a colour name or a  comma  separated  triple  of

          Red, Green and Blue (RGB) components enclosed in square
          brackets. Typing the command help colours will  give  a
          list  of  the  predefined  colour  names  recognised by
          RasMol.  When running  under  X  Windows,  RasMol  also
          recognises  colours in the X server's colour name data-
          base.


     Centre
          The RasMol centre command defines the point about which
          the  rotate  command  and  the  scroll  bars rotate the
          current molecule. Without a parameter the  centre  com-
          mand  resets the centre of rotation to be the centre of
          gravity of the  molecule.  If  an  atom  expression  is
          specified, RasMol rotates the molecule about the centre
          of gravity of the set of atoms specified by the expres-
          sion.  Hence,  if  a  single  atom  is specified by the
          expression, that atom will remain  `stationary'  during
          rotations.

          Type help expression for  more  information  on  RasMol
          atom expressions.


     Colour
          Colour the atoms (or other  objects)  of  the  selected
          zone.  The  colour may be given as either a colour name
          or a comma separated triple  of  Red,  Green  and  Blue
          (RGB)  components  enclosed  in square brackets. Typing
          the command help colours will give a list  of  all  the
          predefined colour names recognised by RasMol.

          Allowed objects are  atoms,  bonds,  backbone,  hbonds,
          ribbons  and  ssbonds.  If  no object is specified, the
          default keyword atom is assumed.  Some  colour  schemes
          are defined for certain object types. The colour scheme
          none can be applied all objects accept  atoms,  stating
          that  the selected objects have no colour of their own,
          but use the colour of their associated atoms (i.e.  the
          atoms they connect).  Atom objects can also be coloured
          by amino, cpk, chain, group, shapely,  structure,  tem-
          perature and user and hydrogen bond objects can also be
          coloured by type. For more information type help colour
          <colour>.


     HBonds
          The RasMol hbond  command  is  used  to  represent  the
          hydrogen  bonding  of  the protein molecule's backbone.
          This information is useful in assessing  the  protein's
          secondary  structure. Hydrogen bonds are represented as
          either dotted lines or cylinders between the donor  and

RASMOL(1)                USER COMMANDS                  RASMOL(1)



          acceptor  residues. The first time the hbond command is
          used,  the  program  searches  the  structure  of   the
          molecule  to  find hydrogen bonded residues and reports
          the number of bonds to the user. The command hbonds  on
          displays  the selected `bonds' as dotted lines, and the
          hbonds off turns off their display. The colour of hbond
          objects  may  be  changed  by the colour hbond command.
          Initially, each hydrogen bond has the  colours  of  its
          connected atoms.

          By default the  dotted  lines  are  drawn  between  the
          accepting  oxygen  and  the donating nitrogen. By using
          the set hbonds command the alpha  carbon  positions  of
          the  appropriate  residues may be used instead. This is
          especially useful when examining proteins  in  backbone
          representation.


     Help The RasMol help command provides on-line  help  on  the
          given topic.


     Load Load either a Brookhaven Protein Databank (PDB) file or
          Alchemy(tm) format file into RasMol2. Only a single PDB
          file may be loaded at a time. This command selects  all
          the  atoms  in  the  molecule,  and  sets  the  default
          representation to be a cpk coloured wireframe model.


     Quit Exit from the RasMol program.


     Renumber
          The RasMol renumber command  sequentially  numbers  the
          residues  in  a  macromolecular  chain.   The  optional
          parameter specifies the value of the first  residue  in
          the  sequence.  By default, this value is one. For pro-
          teins, each amino acid is numbered  consecutively  from
          the  N  terminus  to the C terminus. For nucleic acids,
          each base is numbered from the 5' terminus to  3'  ter-
          minus.  All  chains  in the current database are renum-
          bered and gaps in the original  sequence  are  ignored.
          The starting value for numbering may be negative.


     Reset
          The RasMol reset command restores the original  viewing
          transformation and centre of rotation. The scale is set
          to it default value, zoom 100, the centre  of  rotation
          is  set to the geometric centre of the currently loaded
          molecule, centre all, this centre is translated to  the
          middle  of  the  screen  and  the  viewpoint set to the

          default orientation.

          This command should not be mistaken for the RasMol  zap
          command  which  deletes  the currently stored molecule,
          returning the program to its initial state.


     Restrict
          The RasMol restrict command both defines the  currently
          active  zone of the molecule and disables the represen-
          tation of (most of) those  parts  of  the  molecule  no
          longer  selected.   All subsequent RasMol commands that
          modify a molecule's  colour  or  representation  effect
          only  the  currently  selected zone. The parameter of a
          restrict command is a RasMol atom  expression  that  is
          evaluated  for every atom of the current molecule. This
          command is very similar to the RasMol  select  command,
          except  restrict  disables the wireframe, spacefill and
          backbone representations in the non-active zone.

          Type "help expression" for more information  on  RasMol
          atom expressions.


     Ribbons
          The  RasMol  ribbons  command  displays  the  currently
          loaded  protein  as  a  smooth  "ribbon"  of depth-cued
          curves passing along the backbone of the  protein.  The
          ribbon  is  composed  of  a  number of strands that run
          parallel to one another along the peptide plane of each
          residue.  The  ribbon  is drawn between each amino acid
          whose alpha carbon is currently selected.   The  colour
          of  the  ribbon  is changed by the RasMol colour ribbon
          command. If the current  ribbon  colour  is  none  (the
          default),  the colour is taken from the alpha carbon at
          each position along its length.

          The width of the ribbon at each position is  determined
          by the optional parameter in the usual RasMol units. By
          default this value is 380, which produces a ribbon 1.52
          Angstroms wide. The number of strands in the ribbon may
          be altered using the RasMol set  strands  command.  The
          rendering  of  the ribbon may also be changed using the
          set ribbons command.


     Rotate
          Rotate the molecule about the specified axis.  Permited
          values  for  the  axis  parameter are "x", "y" and "z".
          The integer parameter states the angle in  degrees  for
          the  structure  to  be  rotated.  For the X and Y axes,
          positive values move the closest point  up  and  right,

RASMOL(1)                USER COMMANDS                  RASMOL(1)



          and negative values move it down and left respectively.
          For the Z axis, a positive rotation acts clockwise  and
          a negative angle anti-clockwise.


     Save Save the currently selected set of atoms  in  either  a
          Brookhaven Protein Database (PDB) or Alchemy(tm) format
          file.  This command should not  be  confused  with  the
          RasMol  write  command  which generates either image or
          script files.


     Script
          The RasMol script  command  reads  a  set  of  commands
          sequentially  from  a text file and executes them. This
          allows sequences of commonly used commands to be stored
          and performed by a single command. A RasMol script file
          may contain a further script command up  to  a  maximum
          "depth"  of  10,  allowing  compilicated  sequences  of
          actions to be executed.


     Select
          Define the currently active zone of the  molecule.  All
          subsequent  RasMol  commands that manipulate a molecule
          or modify its colour or  representation,  only  effects
          the  currently selected zone. The parameter of a select
          command is a RasMol expression that  is  evaluated  for
          every  atom  of  the  current  molecule.  The currently
          selected (active) zone of the molecule are those  atoms
          that  cause  the expression to evaluate true. To select
          the whole molecule use the RasMol command select all.

          Type "help expression" for more information  on  RasMol
          atom expressions.


     Set  The RasMol set command allows the user to alter various
          internal  program  parameters such as those controlling
          rendering options. Each parameter has its  own  set  or
          permissible  parameter options. Typically, ommiting the
          paramter option resets that parameter  to  its  default
          value.  A list of valid parameter names is given below.
          For more information on each  internal  parameter  type
          help set <parameter>.


     Show The RasMol show command display details of  the  status
          of  the  currently  loaded  molecule.  The command show
          information lists the molecule's name,  classification,
          PDB  code  and  the  number of atoms, chains, groups it
          contains.  If hydrogen bonding, disulphide  bridges  or

          secondary structure have been determined, the number of
          hbonds, ssbonds, helices, ladders and  turns  are  also
          displayed respectively. The command show sequence lists
          the residues that compose each chain of the molecule.


     Slab The RasMol slab command enables, disables or  positions
          the  z-clipping plane of the molecule. The program only
          draws those portions of the molecule that  are  further
          from  the  viewer  than  the  slabbing  plane.  Integer
          values range   from  zero  at  the  very  back  of  the
          molecule  to  100  which  is completely in front of the
          molecule. Intermediate values determine the  percentage
          of the molecule to be drawn.


     Spacefill
          Represent the currently selected zone as a spacefilling
          union  of  spheres  model.  An integer parameter may be
          used to specify the radius of each atom  given  in  4nm
          units.  If no parameter is given, each atom is drawn as
          a sphere of its Van der Waals radius.

          The temperature option is used to  set  the  radius  of
          each  selected  sphere  to the value in the temperature
          field of the molecule file. A zero  or  negative  value
          causes  no  change  in  the  selected atom. Temperature
          values greater than 2.00 are truncated to 2.00 Angstrom
          radius.

          The user option  allows  the  radius  of  the  selected
          spheres  to be determined by matching each atom against
          optional lines in the input data file. Details  of  the
          wildcard  pattern  matching  used  by  Raster3D's COLOR
          records is given in the manual.


     SSBonds
          The RasMol ssbonds command is  used  to  represent  the
          disulphide  bridges  of  the protein molecule as either
          dotted lines or cylinders between  the  connected  cys-
          teines.  The  first  time  that  the ssbonds command is
          used, the program searches the structure of the protein
          to  find  half-cysteine pairs (cysteines whose sulphurs
          are within 3 angstroms of each other) and  reports  the
          number  of  bridges to the user. The command ssbonds on
          displays the selected `bonds' as dotted lines, and  the
          command  ssbonds off disables the display of ssbonds in
          the currently selected area.  Selection  of  disulphide
          bridges  is  identical  to  normal  bonds,  and  may be
          adjusted using the RasMol  set  bondmode  command.  The
          colour  of  disulphide  bonds  may be changed using the

RASMOL(1)                USER COMMANDS                  RASMOL(1)



          colour ssbonds command.  By  default,  each  disulphide
          bond has the colours of its connected atoms.

          By default disulphide bonds are drawn between the  sul-
          phur atoms within the cysteine groups. By using the set
          ssbonds command the position of  the  cysteine's  alpha
          carbons may be used instead.


     Structure
          The  RasMol  structure  command  calculates   secondary
          structure assignments for the currently loaded protein.
          If the original PDB file contained  structural  assign-
          ment  records  (HELIX  and  SHEET) these are discarded.
          Initially, the hydrogen bonds of the  current  molecule
          are found, if this hasn't been done already. The secon-
          dary structure  is  the  determined  using  Kabsch  and
          Sander's  DSSP  algorithm.  Once  finished  the program
          reports the number of helices and ladders found.


     Translate
          The RasMol translate command moves the position of  the
          centre  of the molecule on the screen. The axis parame-
          ter specifies along which axis the molecule  is  to  be
          moved  and the integer parameter specifies the absolute
          position of the molecule centre from the middle of  the
          screen.   Permited  values  for  the axis parameter are
          "x", "y" and "z".  Displacement values must be  between
          -100  and  100  which  correspond to moving the current
          molecule just off the screen. A positive "x"  displace-
          ment  moves  the  molecule to the right, and a positive
          "y" displacement moves the molecule  down  the  screen.
          The  pair  of  commands translate x 0 and translate y 0
          centres the molecule on the screen.


     Wireframe
          Represent each bond within the  selected  zone  of  the
          molecule  as either a cylinder or depth-cued vector. If
          no parameter is given, RasMol  draws  each  bond  as  a
          hither-and-yon shaded narrow vector. An integer parame-
          ter specifies the radius of a cylinder,  given  in  4nm
          units, to be used as a stick bond.


     Write
          Write the current image to a file in a standard  raster
          format.  Currently  supported  file formats include gif
          (Compuserve  GIF),  ppm  (Portable  Pixmap),  ras  (Sun
          rasterfile),  ps  and  epsf  (Encapsulated PostScript),
          monops (Monochrome  Encapsulated  PostScript)  and  bmp

          (Microsoft bitmap). This command should not be confused
          with the RasMol save command which save  the  currently
          selected portion of the molecule.


     Zap  Deletes the contents of the current database and resets
          parameter variables to their initial default state.


     Zoom Change the magnification  of  the  currently  displayed
          image.  Boolean  parameters either magnify or reset the
          scale of current molecule. An integer parameter between
          10  and  200  specifies  the desired magnification as a
          percentage of the default scale.


SET PARAMETERS
     RasMol has a number of internal parameters that may be modi-
     fied  using  the  set  command.  These  parameters control a
     number of program options  such  as  rendering  options  and
     mouse button mappings.


     Set Ambient
          The RasMol ambient parameter is  used  to  control  the
          amount  of ambient (or surrounding) light in the scene.
          The ambient value must be between 0 and 100  that  con-
          trols  the percentage intensity of the darkest shade of
          an object. For a solid object, this is the intensity of
          surfaces  facing  away from the light source or in sha-
          dow.  For depth-cued objects this is the  intensity  of
          objects furthest from the viewer.

          This parameter is commonly used to correct for monitors
          with  different  "gamma values" (brightness), to change
          how light or dark a hardcopy image appears when printed
          or  to alter the feeling of depth for wireframe or rib-
          bon representations.


     Set Background
          The RasMol background parameter  is  used  to  set  the
          colour  of  the  "canvas" background. The colour may be
          given as either a colour name or a comma separated tri-
          ple  of  Red,  Green, Blue (RGB) components enclosed in
          square brackets. Typing the command help  colours  will
          give  a  list of the predefined colour names recognised
          by RasMol.  When running under X Windows,  RasMol  also
          recognises  colours in the X server's colour name data-
          base.

          The RasMol  hourglass  parameter  allows  the  user  to
          enable  and  disable the use of the `hour glass' cursor
          used  by  RasMol  to  indicate  that  the  program   is
          currently  busy drawing the next frame. The command set
          hourglass on enable the indicator, whilst set hourglass
          off  prevents  RasMol from changing the cursor. This is
          useful when spinning the molecule, running  a  sequence
          of  commands  from  a script file or using interprocess
          communication to execute complex sequences of commands.
          In these cases a `flashing' cursor may be distracting.

     Set Mouse
          The RasMol set mouse command sets the rotation,  trans-
          lation, scaling and zooming mouse bindings. The default
          value is rasmol which is suitable for two  button  mice
          (for three button mice the second and third buttons are
          synonymous); X-Y rotation is controlled  by  the  first
          button,  and  X-Y translation by the second. Additional
          functions are controlled by holding a modifier  key  on
          the  keyboard.   [Shift]  and the first button performs
          scaling, [shift] and  the  second  button  performs  Z-
          rotation, and [control] and the first mouse button con-
          trols the clipping plane. The insight and  quanta  pro-
          vide  the  same  mouse  bindings  as other packages for
          experienced users.


     Set Ribbons
          The RasMol set ribbons command controls  the  way  that
          macromolecular  ribbons  are  displayed.   The  default

          value strands display macromolecular ribbons as  paral-
          lel  depth-cued  strands that pass along the protein or
          nucleic acid backbone. The number  of  strands  in  the
          ribbon may be altered using the RasMol set strands com-
          mand. The set ribbons solid command renders the  macro-
          molecular ribbon as a solid shaded ribbon.


     Set Shadow
          The RasMol set shadow command enables and disables ray-
          tracing  of  the  currently  rendered image.  Currently
          only the spacefilling representation is shadowed or can
          cast  shadows.  Enabling  shadowing  will automatically
          disable the Z-clipping (slabbing) plane using the  com-
          mand slab off. Raytracing typically takes about 10s for
          a moderately sized protein.   It  is  recommended  that
          shadowing  is  normally disabled whilst the molecule is
          being transformed or manipulated, and only enabled once
          an  appropiate  viewpoint  is  selected,  to  provide a
          greater impression of depth.


     Set SlabMode
          The RasMol slabmode parameter  controls  the  rendering
          method  of  objects  cut  by  the slabbing (z-clipping)
          plane. Valid slab modes are "reject", "half", "hollow",
          "solid" and "section".


     Set Specular
          The RasMol set specular command  enables  and  disables
          the  display  of  specular  highlights on solid objects
          drawn by RasMol. Specular highlights  appear  as  white
          reflections  of  the light source on the surface of the
          object.  The  current  RasMol  implementation  uses  an
          approximation function to generate this highlight.

          The  specular  highlights  on  the  surfaces  of  solid
          objects may be altered by using the specular reflection
          coefficient, which is  altered  using  the  RasMol  set
          specpower command.


     Set SpecPower
          The specpower parameter  determines  the  shininess  of
          solid  objects rendered by RasMol. This value between 0
          and 100 adjusts the reflection coeffient used in specu-
          lar highlight calculations. The specular highlights are
          enabled and disabled by the RasMol  set  specular  com-
          mand.  Values  around  20 or 30 produce plastic looking
          surfaces.  High values represent  more  shiny  surfaces
          such   as  metals,  while  lower  values  produce  more

     Set SSBonds

     Set Strands
          The RasMol strands parameter  controls  the  number  of
          parallel  strands  that  are  displayed  in  the ribbon
          representations of proteins. The permissible values for
          this  parameter  are  1,  2, 3, 4, 5 and 9. The default
          value is 5. The number of strands is constant  for  all
          ribbons  being  displayed.   However,  the ribbon width
          (the separation between strands) may be controlled on a
          residue  by residue basis using the RasMol ribbons com-
          mand.


ATOM EXPRESSIONS
     RasMol atom expressions uniquely identify an arbitrary group
     of atoms within a molecule. Atom expressions are composed of
     either primitive expressions,  predefined  sets,  comparison
     operators, within expressions, or logical (boolean) combina-
     tions of the above expression types.

     The logical operators  allow  complex  queries  to  be  con-
     structed out of simpler ones using the standard boolean con-
     nectives and, or and not. These may be  abbreviated  by  the
     symbols  "&",  "|" and "!" respectively. Parentheses (brack-
     ets) may be used to alter the precedence of  the  operators.
     For  convenience,  a comma may also be used for boolean dis-
     junction.

     The atom expression is evaluated for each atom,  hence  pro-
     tein  and  backbone  selects  protein bacbone atoms, not the
     protein and [nucleic] acid backbone atoms!


     Example Expressions
          The following  table  gives  some  useful  examples  of
          RasMol atom expressions.


     Primitive Expressions
          RasMol primitive expressions are the fundamental build-
          ing blocks of atom expressions. There a two basic types
          of primitive expression.  The first  type  is  used  to
          identify  a  given  residue  number or range of residue
          numbers. A single residue is identified by  its  number
          (position in the sequence), and a range is specified by
          lower and upper bounds separated by a hyphen character.

RASMOL(1)                USER COMMANDS                  RASMOL(1)



          For  example  select  5,6,7,8  is also select 5-8. Note
          that this selects the  given  residue  numbers  in  all
          macromolecule chains.

          The second type of  primitive  expression  specifies  a
          sequence  of  fields  that must match for a given atom.
          The first part specifies a residue (or group  of  resi-
          dues)  and  an optional second part specifies the atoms
          within those residues. The first  part  consists  of  a
          residue  name,  optionally followed by a residue number
          and/or chain identifier.  The second part consists of a
          period character followed by an atom name.  An asterisk
          may be used as a wild card for  a  whole  field  and  a
          question mark as a single character wildcard.


     Comparison Operators
          Parts of a molecule may  also  be  distinguished  using
          equality,  inequality  and  ordering operators on their
          properties. The format of such comparison expression is
          a  property name, followed by a comparison operator and
          then an integer value.

          The atom properties that may  be  used  in  RasMol  are
          atomno  for the atom serial number, resno for the resi-
          due number, radius for the spacefill radius  in  RasMol
          units (or zero if not represented as a sphere) and tem-
          perature for the PDB anisotropic temperature value.

          The equality operator is denoted either  "="  or  "==".
          The  inequality  operator as either "<>", "!=" or "/=".
          The ordering operators are "<" for less than, "<="  for
          less  than  or  equal to, ">" for greater than, and ">"
          for greater than or equal to.


     Within Expressions
          A RasMol within expression allows atoms to be  selected
          on  their  proximity  to another set of atoms. A within
          expression takes two parameters separated  by  a  comma
          and surrounded by parenthesis. The first argument is an
          integer value called  the  "cut-off"  distance  of  the
          within expression and the second argument is any  valid
          atom expression. The cut-off distance is  expressed  in
          RasMol  0.004 Angstrom units. An atom is selected if it
          is within the cut-off distance  of  any  of  the  atoms
          defined  by  the  second  argument. This allows complex
          expressions to be constructed containing nested  within
          expressions.

          For example, the  command  select  within(800,backbone)
          selects  any  atom  within a 3.2 Angstrom radius of any

          atom in a protein or  nucleic  acid  backbone.   Within
          expressions  are particularly usefull for selecting the
          atoms around an active site.


     Predefined Sets
          RasMol atom expressions may  contain  predefined  sets.
          Thsese sets are single keywords that represent portions
          of a molecule of interest.  Predefined sets  are  often
          abbreviations  primitive  atom expressions, and in some
          cases of selecting areas of a molecule that  could  not
          otherwise  be  distinguished.  A  list of the currently
          predfined sets is given below.


Predefined Sets
     AT Set
          This  set  contains  the  atoms  in  the  complementary
          nucleotides  adenosine  and  thymidine (A and T respec-
          tively). All nucleotides are classified as  either  the
          set  at  or  the  set  cg This set is equivalent to the
          RasMol atom expressions a,t and nucleic and not cg


     Acidic Set
          The set of acidic amino acids.  These are  the  residue
          types Asp, Glu and Tyr.  All amino acids are classified
          as  either  acidic,  basic  or  neutral.  This  set  is
          equivalent to the RasMol atom expressions asp, glu, tyr
          and amino and not (basic or neutral)


     Acyclic Set
          The set of atoms in amino acids not containing a  cycle
          or  ring.  All  amino  acids  are  classified as either
          cyclic or acyclic. This set is equivalent to the RasMol
          atom expression amino and not cyclic


     Aliphatic Set
          This set contains the aliphatic amino acids.  These are
          the  amino  acids Ala, Gly, Ile, Leu and Val.  This set
          is equiavlent to the RasMol atom expression  ala,  gly,
          ile, leu, val


     Alpha Set
          The set of alpha carbons in the protein molecule.  This
          set  is  approximately  equivalent  to  the RasMol atom
          expression *.CA This command  should  not  be  confused
          with  the predefined set helix which contains the atoms
          in the amino acids of the protein's alpha helices.

     Amino Set
          This set contains all the atoms contained in amino acid
          residues.   This  is useful for distinguishing the pro-
          tein from the nucleic acid and  heterogenous  atoms  in
          the current molecule database.


     Aromatic Set
          The set of atoms in  amino  acids  containing  aromatic
          rings.   These  are  the  amino acids His, Phe, Trp and
          Tyr.  Because they contain aromatic rings  all  members
          of  this  set  are member of the predefined set cyclic.
          This set is equivalent to the RasMol  atom  expressions
          his, phe, trp, tyr and cyclic and not pro


     Backbone Set
          This set contains the four atoms  of  each  amino  acid
          that form the polypeptide N-C-C-O backbone of proteins,
          and the atoms the sugar phosphate backbone  of  nucleic
          acids.   Use  the  RasMol  predefined  sets protein and
          nucleic to distinguish between the two forms  of  back-
          bone.   Atoms  in nucleic acids and proteins are either
          backbone or sidechain. This set is  equivalent  to  the
          RasMol   expression   "(protein  or  nucleic)  and  not
          sidechain


     Basic Set
          The set of basic amino acids.  These  are  the  residue
          types Asp, Glu and Tyr.  All amino acids are classified
          as  either  acidic,  basic  or  neutral.  This  set  is
          equivalent to the RasMol atom expressions asp, glu, tyr
          and amino and not (acidic or neutral)


     Buried Set
          This set contains the atoms in those amino  acids  that
          tend  (prefer) to buried inside protein, away from con-
          tact with solvent molecules. This  set  refers  to  the
          amino acids preference and not the actual solvent aces-
          sibility for the current protein.  All amino acids  are
          classified  as  either  surface  or buried. This set is
          equivalent to the RasMol atom expression amino and  not
          surface


     CG Set
          This  set  contains  the  atoms  in  the  complementary
          nucleotides  cytidine  and  guanoine  (C  and G respec-
          tively). All nucleotides are classified as  either  the
          set  at  or  the  set  cg This set is equivalent to the

     Charged Set
          This set contains the charged amino  acids.  These  are
          the  amino acids that are either acidic or basic. Amino
          acids are classified as being either  charged  or  neu-
          tral. This set is equivalent to the RasMol atom expres-
          sions acidic or basic and amino and not neutral


     Cyclic Set
          The set of atoms in amino acids containing a  cycle  or
          rings.  All amino acids are classified as either cyclic
          or acyclic. This set consists of the amino  acids  His,
          Phe,  Pro,  Trp and Tyr.  The members of the predefined
          set aromatic are members of this set.  The only  cyclic
          but  non-aromatic  amino  acid is proline.  This set is
          equivalent to the RasMol  atom  expressions  his,  phe,
          pro,  trp,  tyr  and  aromatic or pro and amino and not
          acyclic


     Cystine Set
          This set contains the atoms of cysteine  residues  that
          form  part  of a disulphide bridge, i.e. half cystines.
          RasMol automatically determines disulphide bridges,  if
          neither  the  predefined  set  cystine  nor  the RasMol
          ssbonds command have been used since the  molecule  was
          loaded.  The  set  of  free cysteines may be determined
          using the RasMol atom expression cys and not cystine


     Helix Set
          This set contains all atoms that form part of a protein
          alpha helix as determined by either the PDB file author
          or Kabsch and  Sander's  DSSP  algorithm.  By  default,
          RasMol uses the secondary structure determination given
          in the PDB file if it exists.  Otherwise, it  uses  the
          DSSP algorithm as used by the RasMol structure command.

          This command should not be confused with the predefined
          set  alpha  which  contains the alpha carbon atoms of a
          protein.


     Hetero Set
          This set contains all the  heterogenous  atoms  in  the
          molecule.  These  are  the  atoms  described  by HETATM
          entries in the PDB file. These typically contain water,
          cofactors  and  other solvents and ligands.  The RasMol

          This set contains  all  the  hydrophobic  amino  acids.
          These are the amino acids Ala, Leu, Val, Ile, Pro, Phe,
          Met and Trp.  All amino acids are classified as  either
          hydrophobic  or  polar.  This  set is equivalent to the
          RasMol atom expressions ala, leu, val, ile,  pro,  phe,

     Large Set
          All amino acids are classified as either small,  medium
          or  large.  This  set  is equivalent to the RasMol atom
          expression amino and not (small or medium)


     Medium Set
          All amino acids are classified as either small,  medium
          or  large.  This  set  is equivalent to the RasMol atom

          The set of neutral amino acids.  All  amino  acids  are
          classified as either acidic, basic or neutral. This set
          is equivalent to the RasMol atom expression  amino  and
          not (acidic or basic)

     Polar Set
          This set contains the polar  amino  acids.   All  amino
          acids  are  classified  as either hydrophobic or polar.

     Purine Set
          The set of purine nucleotides.   These  are  the  bases
          adenosine  and  guanosine  (A and G respectively).  All
          nucleotides are either purines or pyrimidines. This set
          is  equivalent  to  the RasMol atom expressions a,g and

     Pyrimidine Set
          The set of pyrimidine nucleotides.  These are the bases
          cytidine  and  thymidine  (C  and T respectively).  All
          nucleotides are either  purineset  purines  or  pyrimi-

     Selected Set
          This set contains the set of  atoms  in  the  currently
          active  zone.   The currently active zone is defined by
          the preceding select or restrict command  and  not  the
          atom expression containing the selected keyword.


     Sheet Set
          This set contains all atoms that form part of a protein
          beta  sheet as determined by either the PDB file author
          or Kabsch and  Sander's  DSSP  algorithm.  By  default,
          RasMol uses the secondary structure determination given
          in the PDB file if it exists.  Otherwise, it  uses  the
          DSSP algorithm as used by the RasMol structure command.


     Sidechain Set
          This set contains  the  functional  sidechains  of  any
          amino  acids and the base of each nucleotide. These are
          the atoms not part of the polypeptide N-C-C-O  backbone
          of  proteins or the sugar phosphate backbone of nucleic
          acids.  Use the  RasMol  predefined  sets  protein  and

          or  large.  This  set  is equivalent to the RasMol atom
          expression amino and not (medium or large)

          This set contains the atoms in those amino  acids  that
          tend (prefer) to be on the surface of proteins, in con-
          tact with solvent molecules. This  set  refers  to  the
          amino acids preference and not the actual solvent aces-
          sibility for the current protein.  All amino acids  are
          classified  as  either  surface  or buried. This set is
          equivalent to the RasMol atom expression amino and  not
          buried


     Turn Set
          This set contains all atoms that form part of a protein
          turns  as  determined  by either the PDB file author or
          Kabsch and Sander's DSSP algorithm. By default,  RasMol
          uses the secondary structure determination given in the
          PDB file if it exists.  Otherwise,  it  uses  the  DSSP
          algorithm as used by the RasMol structure command.


     Water Set
          This set contains all the heterogenous water  molecules
          in  the  current  database.  A  large  number  of water
          molecules are sometimes  associated  with  protein  and
          nucleic acid structures determined by X-ray crystallog-
          raphy. These atoms tend to clutter an image.


COLOUR SCHEMES
     The RasMol colour command allows different objects (such  as
     atoms,  bonds  and  ribbon segments) to be given a specified
     colour. Typically this colour is either a RasMol  predefined
     colour  name or an RGB triple. Additionally RasMol also sup-
     ports amino, chain, group, shapely, structure,  temperature,
     user  and  hbond  type colour schemes.  The currently prede-
     fined colour names are


     Amino Colours
          The RasMol amino  colour  scheme  colours  amino  acids
          according  to  traditional  amino  acid properties. The
          purpose of colouring is to identify amino acids  in  an
          unusual or surprising environment. The outer parts of a
          protein are polar  are  visible  (bright)  colours  and
          non-polar residues darker. Most colours are hallowed by
          tradition. This colour scheme is similar to the shapely
          scheme.


     Chain Colours
          The RasMol chain colour scheme assigns each macromolec-
          ular  chain a unique colour. This colour scheme is par-
          ticularly  usefull  for  distinguishing  the  parts  of

          multimeric  structure  or the individual `strands' of a
          DNA chain.


     CPK Colours
          The RasMol cpk colour scheme is based upon the  colours
          of  the  popular plastic spacefilling models which were
          developed by Corey, Pauling and later improved by  Kul-
          tun.  This  colour  scheme colour `atom' objects by the
          atom (element) type. This is the scheme  conventionally
          used by chemists.


     Group Colours
          The RasMol group colour scheme colour codes residues by
          their position in a macromolecular chain. Each chain is
          drawn as a smooth spectrum  from  blue  through  green,
          yellow  and orange to red. Hence the N terminus of pro-
          teins and 5' terminus of nucleic acids are coloured red
          and  the  C  terminus  of  proteins  and 3' terminus of
          nucleic acids are drawn in blue. If a chain has a large
          number  of  heterogenous  molecules associated with it,
          the macromolecule may not be drawn in the full  `range'
          of the spectrum.


     Shapely Colours
          The RasMol shapely colour scheme colour codes  residues
          by  amino  acid property. This scheme is based upon Bob
          Fletterick's "Shapely  Models".  Each  amino  acid  and
          nucleic  acid  residue  is  given  a unique colour. The
          shapely colour scheme is used by David Bacon's Raster3D
          program.  This  colour  scheme  is similar to the amino
          colour scheme.


     Structure Colours
          The RasMol structure colour scheme colours the molecule
          by  protein  secondary  structure.   Alpha  helices are
          coloured magenta,  beta  sheets  are  coloured  yellow,
          turns  are  coloured  pale  blue,  [96,128,255] and all
          other residues are coloured white. The secondary struc-
          ture  is either read from the PDB file (HELIX and SHEET
          records), if available, or determined using Kabsch  and
          Sander's  DSSP  algorithm. The RasMol structure command
          may be used to force DSSP's structure assignment to  be
          used.


     Temperature Colours
          The RasMol temperature colour scheme colour codes  each
          atom  according  to  the anisotropic temperature (beta)

          value stored in the PDB file. Typically  this  gives  a
          measure  of  the mobility/uncertainty of a given atom's
          position. High values  are  coloured  in  warmer  (red)
          colours and lower values in colder (blue) colours. This
          feature is often used  to  associate  a  "scale"  value
          [such  as amino acid variability in viral mutants] with
          each atom in  a  PDB  file,  and  colour  the  molecule
          appropriately.


     User Colours
          The RasMol user colour scheme allows RasMol to use  the
          colour  scheme  stored in the PDB file. The colours for
          each atom are stored in COLO records placed in the  PDB
          data  file.  This  convention  was introducted by David
          Bacon's Raster3D program.


     HBond Type Colours
          The RasMol type colour scheme applies only to  hydrogen
          bonds,  hence is used in the command colour hbonds type
          This colour scheme  colour  codes  each  hydrogen  bond
          according to the distance along a protein chain between
          hydrogen  bond  donor  and  acceptor.   This  schematic
          representation  was  introduced  by Belhadj-Mostefa and
          Milner-White. This representation gives a good  insight
          into  protein secondary structure (hbonds forming alpha
          helices appear red, those forming sheets appear  yellow
          and those forming turns appear magenta).
