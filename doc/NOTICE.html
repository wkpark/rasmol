The IUCr Policy for the Protection and the Promotion<BR>
of the STAR File and CIF Standards<BR>
for Exchanging and Archiving Electronic Data<BR>
</h2>
 <h3>Overview</h3>
 
  The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for information
  interchange promulgated by the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr).
  CIF (Hall, Allen &amp; Brown, 1991) is the recommended method for submitting
  publications to Acta Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal
  structure determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica and many
  other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the more general STAR
  File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches are used increasingly in
  the structural sciences for data exchange and archiving, and are having a
  significant influence on these activities in other fields.
 
 
  <h3>Statement of intent</h3>
 
  The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data interchange
  standard for science, and its interest in the CIF, a conformant derivative
  of the STAR File, is as a concise data exchange and archival standard
  for crystallography and structural science.
 
 
  <h3>Protection of the standards</h3>
 
  To protect the STAR File and the CIF as standards for interchanging and
  archiving electronic data, the IUCr, on behalf of the scientific community,
 <ul>
        <li> holds the copyrights on the standards themselves,
 
        <li> owns the associated trademarks and service marks, and
 
        <li> holds a patent on the STAR File.
 </ul>
 
  These intellectual property rights relate solely to the interchange
  formats, not to the data contained therein, nor to the software used
  in the generation, access or manipulation of the data.
 
 
  <h3>Promotion of the standards</h3>
 
  The sole requirement that the IUCr, in its protective role, imposes on
  software purporting to process STAR File or CIF data is that the following
  conditions be met prior to sale or distribution.
 
 <ul>
  <li>  Software claiming to <b>read</b> files written to either the STAR File or the
     CIF standard must be able to extract the pertinent data from a file
     conformant to the STAR File syntax, or the CIF syntax, respectively.
 
  <li>  Software claiming to <b>write</b> files in either the STAR File, or the CIF,
     standard must produce files that are conformant to the STAR File syntax,
     or the CIF syntax, respectively.
 
  <li>  Software claiming to <b>read</b> definitions from a specific data dictionary
     <b>approved by the IUCr</b> must be able to extract any pertinent definition
     which is conformant to the dictionary definition language (DDL)[3]
     associated with that dictionary.
 </ul>
  The IUCr, through its Committee on CIF Standards, will assist any developer
  to verify that software meets these conformance conditions.
 
  <h3>Glossary of terms</h3>
 
<dl>
  <dt>[1] CIF:</dt><dd>      is a data file conformant to the file syntax defined at

  <dt>[3] DDL:</dt><dd>      is a language used in a data dictionary to define data
                 items in terms of "attributes". Dictionaries currently
                 approved by the IUCr, and the DDL versions used to
                 construct these dictionaries, are listed at
