To build RasMol version 2.3

UNIX X11:
==========
[1] Modify the contents of the Makefile to determine your local C compiler,
    compiler and linker options. The default set up is for an 8bit UNIX
    workstation with the X11 shared memory extension, compiled using the
    GNU C Compiler. Changing the line "CC=gcc" to "CC=cc" will use the
    machines native compiler but will require changing "CFLAGS" for your
    platform.

    RasMol may be build for E&S workstations using the command "make esv".

    Alternatively (or if the first method fails), type "xmkmf" to generate 
    a Makefile for your particular system from the included Imakefile!

    A common problem is that SUN OpenWindows keeps its include files in the
    directory /usr/openwin/include/X11, hence the compiler directive 
    -I/usr/openwin/include must be added to CFLAGS.

[2] Modify the #defines in the file rasmol.h (see below)
        Note: IBMPC should not be defined.
[3] Compile the program using the UNIX make utility. (i.e. type "make")
[4] Place the 'rasmol' executable on the execution PATH, i.e. /usr/local/bin
[5] Install rasmol.hlp as /usr/local/lib/rasmol/rasmol.hlp (or at a loctaion
    indicated by the environment variable RASMOLPATH).
[6] If you have the UNIX utilities "uncompress" or "gunzip" ensure they are
    on the user's default PATH.
[7] Set the environment variable RASMOLPDBPATH to the directory containing
    the Broohaven PDB database, if one exits.
[8] Place any system wide initialisation parameters into the file "rasmolrc"
    in the directory pointed to by RASMOLPATH.
[9] It is possible to set-up RASMOLPATH and RASMOLPDBPATH each time the 
    program is running by renaming rasmol to rasmol.exe, and using a script
    similar to the following.
[10] If appropriate place "rasmol.1" or "rasmol.0" in the appropriate place
     for UNIX man pages, and optionally place "rasmol.html" somewhere in 
     your WWW hierarchy (if available at your site).

===========================================================================
#!/bin/sh
RASMOLPATH=/usr/common/lib/rasmol
export RASMOLPATH

RASMOLPDBPATH=/data/brookhaven 
export RASMOLPDBPATH

rasmol.exe $*
===========================================================================


MS Windows v3.1:
================
[1] Use Makefile.pc instead of Makefile, by copying it to MAKEFILE.
[2] Modify the contents of the Makefile to determine your local C compiler,
    compiler and linker options. 
[3] Modify the #defines in the file rasmol.h (see below)
        Note: EIGHTBIT, INVERT and IBMPC should all be defined
              MITSHM, TERMIOS and DIALBOX should not be defined.
[4] Compile the program using the Microsoft Optimizing C Compiler Version
    7's (or Microsoft Visual C++'s) NMAKE program under MS-DOS.
[5] Copy both the executable RASWIN.EXE, RASMOL.HLP and RASWIN.HLP to an
    appropriate directory.
[6] Install the program in MS Windows using the New option of the Program
    Manager's File Menu. Set the Description of the Program to "RasWin v2.3"
    and the Current Directory, to the directory containing the files.
[7] Install the RasMol Help file using the New option of the Program
    Manager's File Menu. Set the Description to "RasWin Manual", the
    command to "C:\WINDOWS\WINHELP RASWIN.HLP" and the working directory
    to the appropriate directory.



VAX/VMS
=======
[1] Modify the #defines in the file rasmol.h (see below)
        Note: IBMPC, MITSHM and TERMIOS should not be defined.
[2] If your VAX site has an MMS license type the command "MMS",
    otherwise use the DCL build script by typing "@build.com"
[3] The program may be run by typing "RUN RASMOL.EXE", the X Windows
    server is specified by a VMS command of the form:
	SET DISPLAY/CREATE/TRANSPORT=TCPIP/NODE=<hostname>




COMPILATION DIRECTIVES
======================

The file rasmol.h contains a number of #define directives that control
the runtime behaviour of the program. The following directives may be
defined or undefined to suite the local site.

EIGHTBIT	This determines whether RasMol will display and produce
		8bit or 32(24) bit output. By default this symbol is defined
		producing images with up to 256 colours. This symbol must 
                be defined if IBMPC is defined.

DIALBOX		This enables the use of a dials box, that is connected 
		using the X Window System XInput extension. This option
		requires that the program be compiled with the Xinput and
		Xext libraries. Note: libXinput is called libXi on SGI 
		machines, so requires the compiler option -lXi!

MITSHM 		This option enables the use of the X Window System MIT shared
		memory extension. This enables images to be displayed faster
		when RasMol and the X11 server are running on the same host.
		This option requires the program be compiled with the Xext
		library. This is now enabled by default.

TERMIOS		This directive enables the command line processing on UNIXs
		that support the termios terminal handling routines. By 
		leaving this symbol undefined, RasMol omits the interactive
		command line interface. Undefining is not recommended!

INVERT          This determines whether the image should be rendered upside-
		down or the right way up. Due to to wonders of MS Windows 
		this must be defined in IBMPC is defined.

ISQRT		This enables the use of the integer square root function in
		the program. This is enabled by default. It was added to
                avoid a compiler bug on SUN 386i machines. This should also
		be commented out for DEC Alpha machines in native 64bit mode.

IBMPC           This determines whether the program is intended to run on an
                IBM PC or compatible under MS Windows or a UNIX workstation.
                By default, this option is disabled. If this option is defined
		the options EIGHTBIT and INVERT must be defined, and TERMIOS
		undefined.


PROBLEMS, BUGS AND SOLUTIONS
============================

If you have any comments on the installation and implementation of RasMol
please send me e-mail "rasmol@dcs.ed.ac.uk" or to the contact address given
in the README file. Any additional patches, fixes or code will gladly be
included in the next release of RasMol. I'm particularly interested in the
problems of sites with different hardware.
