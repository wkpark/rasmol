  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

       THIS IS A PRELIMINARY RELEASE INVOLVING EXTENSIVE MODIFICATIONS
                        ***** USE WITH CAUTION ******

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                  IMPORTANT

This version is based on RasMol version 2.6_CIF.2, on RasMol version 2.6x1
and on RasMol version 2.6.4. Please read the file NOTICE for important
notices which apply to this package. If you are not going to make changes to
RasMol, you are not only permitted to freely make copies and distribute
them, you are encouraged to do so, provided you do the following:

   * 1. Either include the complete documentation, especially the file
     NOTICE, with what you distribute or provide a clear indication where
     people can get a copy of the documentation; and
   * 2. Please give credit where credit is due citing the version and
     original authors properly; and
   * 3. Please do not give anyone the impression that the original authors
     are providing a warranty of any kind.

If you would like to use major pieces of RasMol in some other program, make
modifications to RasMol, or in some other way make what a lawyer would call
a "derived work", you are not only permitted to do so, you are encouraged to
do so. In addition to the things we discussed above, please do the
following:

   * 4. Please explain in your documentation how what you did differs from
     this version of RasMol; and
   * 5. Please make your modified source code available.

This version of RasMol is not in the public domain, but it is given freely
to the community in the hopes of advancing science. If you make changes,
please make them in a responsible manner, and please offer us the
opportunity to include those changes in future versions of RasMol.

Combining RasMol Variants

The first steps in combining RasMol variants have been performed. Much of
the work of upgrading the documentation has been done. It remains to make
the changes to prepdoc to generate the RasFrames version. Several source mod
packages are being reviewed for inclusion. Features from other variants of
RasMol will be considered for inclusion in RasMol 2.7.n if the features are
particularly popular and if available resources (or helpful colleagues) make
inclusion of those features feasible. When we are done, probably in the
early fall, the resulting best version should be a reasonably stable and
reliable single version combining most of the features of the major current
variants of RasMol.

As of this release, we have much of the UCB mods in RasMol 2.7.2, and new
multilingual mods in RasMol 2.7.1.1. These will be combined with other mods
to create RasMol 2.7.2.1.

Some other important things still to be done

   * Finish incorporating A. Mueller's fixes for color management.
   * CIF and mmCIF write logic.
   * The read logic for large NMR structures on a Mac needs to be made to
     work.
   * The field widths for alternate conformer ID's and chains need to be
     extended to allow for the more flexible naming in mmCIF.
   * Resolve problem with interaction of stereo and shadows.
   * Allow writing of GIFs from high colour-resolution mode.
   * Improve memory management on Macs to allow larger structures.
